Real Time Chat System:
In this project I have used PHP for backend, MySql for database management, and for frontend I've used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3,
jQuery and particle.js plugin for animation.
Basically through this application fristly user need to create their account and using valid login credentials user will 
successfully logged in into the application and start chatting with the other online users (who are logged in at the same time).
User can change and remove their profile as well.
